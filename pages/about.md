## About ICLS


The Iowa Chinese Language School (ICLS), as a non-profit and volunteer-based 501(c) (3), racially nondiscriminatory and equal opportunity organization, was established on July 17, 1999. ICLS is also a member of Chinese School Association in the United States (CSAUS). ICLS currently has an enrollment of 100+ students aged from 4 to adult in seventeen classes. The teachers are selected from the volunteers who have Mandarin Chinese as their native language and hold at least Bachelor degree and have teaching skills. ICLS offers regular classes and short courses/seminars. T he regular classes are taught on each Sunday afternoon except for holiday weekends at Johnston High School. The standard curriculum supplemented with organized outside-classroom activities is applied to regular class teaching. Outside-classroom activities include Drawing, Dancing, and Basketball, which are all taught in Chinese. Short courses and seminars can be offered on demand to business people and tourists who want to learn very basic Chinese language (basic conversation) and to get familiar with Chinese culture/costumes and recent development.
