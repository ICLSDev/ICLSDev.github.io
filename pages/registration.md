1. Registration will be handled online preferably. Access the Iowa Chinese Language School (ICLS) online registration site by clicking "Registration" on the menu at www.IowaChineseSchool.org.
2. New students will need to pay $25 non-refundable enrollment fee in order to be on file.  Any student or participant may be asked by school administrators at any time to provide proof of age or dependency.
3. The tuition fee is $170 for Sunday language classes and $80 for other classes including basketball, chess and painting per semester for each student.  For the language class, the 2nd or thereafter student in the same family will have a discount of $20 each. The tuition of language and non-language classes will be $160 and $75 respectively if you use the online registration.
4. Full payment for all registered classes is to be paid on the first day of the semester ({{ site.semester_start }}).
5. The minimum enrollment of six students per class is required for the school to continue the planned class. By the second Sunday after school starts, the classes with insufficient enrollment will be canceled or combined with a similar program. However, the class without enough students granted by the School Board will be continued.
