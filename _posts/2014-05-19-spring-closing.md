The Iowa Chinese Language School (ICLS) 2013~2014 school year closing ceremony was held on May 18, 2014 in Johnston High School. About 200 people, including teachers, students, parents, and grandparents attended the ceremony. Ms. Zhang, Qingyuan, ICLS advisory council member and director of Global Trade Finance at John Deere Credit Financial joined us and presented awards to the teachers, students and volunteers.

Iowa Chinese Language School has been continuously growing ever since it was founded in 1999. It has attracted more and more people in the Des Moines and surrounding areas, who are interested in learning Chinese.
