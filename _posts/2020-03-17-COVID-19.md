Due to the growing number of COVID-19 cases in Iowa, the Johnston Community School District will be following that recommendation and closing schools until April 13, 2020.  Our school will follow the same recommendation and closing schools until April 19. The plan is re open at April 19 but it could change based on COVID-19 situation. I will let you know when anything change.

 

由于新冠病毒在IOWA的疫情。Johnston学区关闭，一直到4月13日。中文学校也会关闭，并初步定于4月19日恢复上课，如果情况变化学校会跟据疫情调整。
